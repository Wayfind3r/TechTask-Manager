# TechTask-Manager

   An application for tracking repair activities in a Repair Center, inspired by my current job.
   The goal of this app is to track which technicians are currently available,
   delegate units awaiting repair to technicians and moving them to QA or Archive.
   
   Uses WPF for the UI.
   The database was designed using Entity Framework(Modelfirst)
